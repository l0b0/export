# NAME
#        Delicious.sh - Download your bookmarks
#
# SYNOPSIS
#        Delicious.sh <username> <password> <save path>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#        Downloads the bookmarks at Delicious as an XML file.
#
#        How to export at midnight every day:
#
#        First, make sure nobody else can read your crontab. If not, they can
#        get access to your password, and I'm not good at sympathy.
#
#        $ git clone git://github.com/l0b0/export.git
#
#        $ crontab -e
#
#        Insert a new line with the following contents (replacing the example
#        paths and login with your own):
#
#        @midnight /.../export/Delicious.sh user password /.../bookmarks.xml
