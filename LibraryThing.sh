# NAME
#        LibraryThing.sh - Download your library
#
# SYNOPSIS
#        LibraryThing.sh <username> <password> <save path>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#        Downloads the entire library of a single user in comma-separated
#        values (CSV) format.
#
#        How to save your personal library at midnight every day:
#
#        $ git clone git://github.com/l0b0/export.git
#
#        $ crontab -e
#
#        Insert a new line with the following contents (replacing the example
#        paths and login with your own):
#
#        @midnight /.../export/LibraryThing.sh user password /.../lt.csv
#
#        Don't blame me if you didn't protect the password well enough. If
#        you've got a suggestion for improving the security, please let me 
#        know.
