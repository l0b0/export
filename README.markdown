Install
-------

    git submodule update --init
    sudo make install

Use
---
Normal use is documented in each of the files. If you just want to make nightly backups, you can use the `install-crontab-*` targets to create `crontab` entries. **Make sure to make a `crontab` backup first!** I have only tested the `crontab` targets on my own machine, and I take no responsibility for any lost data.
